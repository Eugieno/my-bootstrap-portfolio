# my-bootstrap-portfolio

## What problem was solved
As a student web developer, I want to optimise (minimise) the development time for my Personal portfolio webpage without making compromises to responsive design and accessibility features. 

## Why is this important
 It is important beacause I want to be able to build, test and deploy web applications with a pace and precision that meets the taste of future clients and customers and yet creates the best user experience for end-users of these web applications. 

 ## How was the problem solved
 The problem was solved by applying relevant components from boostrap 4 framework and customising them using CSS overrides in the proccess of re-creating the webpage. 

 The webpage has 4 major sections namely Header, About me, Work (or portfolio) and Footer. These sections are coded sequentially according to the below issues;

 1. Coding the main navigation and hero section 
 2. Coding the About me section (with contact/skills) 
 3. Coding the Work section 
 4. Coding the footer section 

 In addition, images in the website were optimised to allow for faster loading - leading to better UX by implementing the following; 
 1. Compression of image files
 2. Lazy loading


 ## Outcome 
 The time taken to build each section of the portfoilo webpage was 30-40% less compared to the build time for my previous project (without the use of a framework). 

 The following image shows the appearance of each sections of the webpage after implementing each issues.
